# Medicare Investigators - OpenAvenues

In continuation of my Exploratory Data Analysis [here](https://github.com/Dameme1/EDA-OpenAvenues/blob/main/Tameem_Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb). 
I will be further cleaning that data and merging it with a nationwide dataset of doctors/clinicians from the CMS.gov website

The goal of this merged dataset is to develop a dataset to help clinicians/scientists choose doctors to run their clinical trials 

This final project can be viewed [here](https://github.com/Dameme1/OpenAvenuesMedicareInvestigators/blob/main/Data_Analysis.ipynb).


#### Dataset
There are three datasets used in this project. The first two were analyzed and explained in the Exploratory Data Analysis above...
The third will be the nationwide dataset from the CMS website.
The data sets include doctors names, NPI's, which medical school, and more that will be important for clinicians to know before choosing their potential hires.
