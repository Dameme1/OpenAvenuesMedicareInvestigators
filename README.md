# Medicare Investigators - OpenAvenues

In continuation of my Exploratory Data Analysis [here](https://github.com/Dameme1/EDA-OpenAvenues/blob/main/Tameem_Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb). 
I will be further cleaning that data and merging it with a nationwide dataset of doctors/clinicians from the CMS.gov website

In this project I develop a dataset to help clinicians/scientists choose doctors to run their clinical trials 

This final project can be viewed [here](https://github.com/Dameme1/OpenAvenuesMedicareInvestigators/blob/main/Data_Analysis.ipynb).


#### Dataset
The data sets in this analysis is of doctors that include their names, NPI's, medical school as well as the DAC dataset from the CMS website with around 2 
doctors nationwide.
